Plottable.js
============

Plottable.js is a library for easily creating beautiful, flexible, interactive, and performant charts for the web. It is built on top of d3 and provides a higher level of abstraction: the developer does not need to worry about d3's low-level components and can easily access many chart renderers, interaction patterns, and a flexible layout engine. Plottable.js is being developed by Palantir Technologies, and is written in TypeScript.

Plottable.js is currently in early alpha and does not yet have a stable API.
