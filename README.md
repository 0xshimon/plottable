plottable.js
============

Plottable.js is a library for easily creating beautiful, flexible, interactive, and performant charts for the web. It is built on top of d3 and provides a hgiher level of abstracting, so the developer does not need to worry about d3's low-level components and can easily access many chart renderers, interaction patterns, and a flexible layout engine. Plottable is being developed by Palantir Technologies, and is written in Typescript.

Plottable is currently in early alpha and does not yet have a stable API.
